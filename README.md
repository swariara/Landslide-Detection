# Landslide Detection Using Multi-Band Satellite Imagery

## Overview

This project develops a robust machine learning pipeline to detect landslides from multi-band satellite imagery data. It combines deep learning (CNN) with boosting models (XGBoost, LightGBM) and a stacking ensemble to improve classification performance.

The data consists of multi-band satellite images with 12 spectral bands (including optical and radar bands). The task is to classify each image as either **Landslide** or **No Landslide**.
